		<h3>&emsp;1. &nbsp; Keropok lekor </h3>
		<p>
 		<li>The uniqueness of 'keropok losong' is that the ones here are tastier and softer compared to those sold elsewhere. In the past, 'keropok lekor' sold were mini-sized, which was about 5 to 6 inches only, and they tasted better than the ones produced today. </li>
		<li>Beginning with keropok lekor, many residents have developed a taste for baking bread and cakes. Kampung Losong is an absolute must-see for visitors to Kuala Terengganu.</li>
		<li>The price at that time was only RM0.20 for small-sized 'keropok' and RM1.00 for large-sized ones. However, due to high demand from the market almost every day, 'keropok' has been made in larger sizes, and Kampung Losong has become the renowned producer of 'keropok' in Malaysia.</li>

		<h3>&emsp;2. &nbsp; Ulik Mayang</h3>
		<p>
 		<li>Ulik Mayang (Alternative spelling: Ulit Mayang, Ulek Mayang) is a famous cultural presentation in the Terengganu community and is presented as one of the cultural expressions of Terengganu today.</li>
		<li>Like other mystical Malay rituals, Ulik Mayang is said to be used for medicinal purposes. However, according to oral stories, from the 1950s to the late 1970s, Ulik Mayang was used freely as a 'manhood' challenge to see who could resist possession.</li>

 		<h3>&emsp;3. &nbsp; Rodat Terengganu </h3>
		<p>
 		<li>Rodat is a prominent culture in Terengganu. At present, rodat may be an unfamiliar term, but it is actually a unique heritage of Terengganu with no equivalent in neighboring regions. Until now, there is no study that can conclusively determine the origin of rodat and how this culture evolved into a distinctive aspect of Terengganu's cultural identity.</li>
		<li>In the Darat region of Kuala Terengganu, especially, rodat grew quickly. Before successfully capturing the interest of the entire Terengganu population when presented at events like Maulidur Rasul and Sultan's Birthday celebrations, and even expanding to popular events like weddings, circumcision ceremonies, beach activities, and festive gatherings, the areas around Kampung Pasir Panjang and Kampung Gong Tok Nasek were the areas of rodat development.</li>
		<li>To further enhance rodat as a unique cultural legacy of Terengganu, serious efforts are still made to conserve the art of rodat poetry and its accompanying artistic forms. This demonstrates that even when celebrating, Terengganu people never lose their traditions.</li>
